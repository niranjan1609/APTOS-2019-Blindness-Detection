Deep Learning Solution for the Kaggle Challenge-APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection link:https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection

This is a Challenge in Kaggle named APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection. In this project we have made use of PreTrained EfficientnetB7 model which is best 
model that when trained and valildated on ImageNet dataset gave out a good amount of accuracy.So in this project we were able to acheive a good score
of about 0.884135 on the private dataset and also on public dataset we were able to acheive a score of 0.720023
